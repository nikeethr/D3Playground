100,"Thank you for taking my call, Thea. I will also sent this feedback regarding your BOM app.  The BOM weather app is not as good as one called ""Weather Australia"" which has just stopped being supplied by www.funtopia.tv.  You have the best weather site on line (we are farmers and look a few times each day) but your app is not as usable as Weather Australia.  The main differences are - No cover page/ cloud scene when we turn it on.  Bom would be better to go straight to the page as you waste our time when we just want to check wind or rain etc before lighting a stubble or spraying a crop.  Weather Australia had four options up the top of the page, but also immediately opened into the first option page - OVERVIEW - actual data on wind temp rain etc for that day and a sentence and a scroll down to the following day below set up the same way.  Up the top of the page were the four option symbols, including three  further options: FORECAST - a one page forecast of the week  in picture/symbol and one sentence per day.

I an Android userand I think your app is awesome. For the last couple of years I've been hoping that you would include an 'expected rainfall' figure after the 'rain since' figure on the 'next 24 hours' page.

 When you click on the radar  your site uses the Sydney radar site and not Newcastle.   You should be able to select the radar you wish to use for the rain and the distance you prefer. In other applications you can do this. 

 I do you like the other features regarding whether information like temperature and likelihood of rain the other thing that would be good is the wind information for example when you're on the full site you can look at the wind direction to and from your local radar I believe this is handy for storm information.

582,"Hi,
The mobile site is great, though a couple of points.
1) If only it would give me weather for my town! 
I entered my location as postcode 4355 and chose Crows Nest Qld.
I gather we don't have a monitoring station here in Crows Nest as the mobile site tells me it is supplying data from the Oakey Qld weather station. I'm afraid Crows Nest's escarpment weather and topology is nothing like the plains of Oakey so the data is useless.
Toowoomba Qld weather would be more appropriate, though still different, as our weather tends to be more like Kingaroy for temps.

2) Pity the radar map wasn't bigger to start with - more like the Rain? App.
Hope you consider some changes - but still love your mobile site.

I'm work for Fisheries Queensland and am currently involved with the development of a recreational fishing app.  As part of this it would be great to provide a link in the app to the mobile warnings page of your app for a given state.  Currently we can only send the user directly to the main screen.

Are there any plans to enable this? eg. http://m.bom.gov.au/qld/warnings would take the user to the warning page for that state?  Currently the url requires an actually location.

A day with a 60% chance of any rain and a range of 0.2-0.6mm would not encourage me to take an umbrella. A day with only a 20% chance of any rain but a range of 1-3mm would.

1361,Just added the mobile site and it's great - I especially love the 'use current location' feature & the inclusion of the radar. I'd like to request you add an option to view the national radar as well as the chosen location one - maybe on the options menu with the capital cities? Sometimes it's nice to see an overall view and it would be great to be able to do that without launching the full BOM site!,3,11.225871000000001,41.239647

I heard on 2UE radio you may launch an app?
If so, it would be great to see the breakdown of expected rainfall in 3 hour segments (like MetEye text version).
Also, the app I currently use has 48 hours forecast rather than 24 hours.
If an app is created, happy to see advertisements on it if app is free. And you could offer an ad free version for a couple of dollars. 
I paid $1.99 for the one I use, it's ad free and great.
If you created one with the added detail mentioned, I would definitely buy the ad free version.

1379,"On the app the wind speeds need to be both in k's and knots. Older people will use this app too. Particularly fishermen.  Also I emailed a request some time ago for the BoM to build an historic data base at Cairns Racecourse like they do at the Airport site (monthly , yearly temp/rain etc). Not just the past ""3 days"" as it does now. Sorry if this is off topic but I suspect the same people are responsible for both data sets. Can this be rectified? I love the ""WOW"" page and it is long overdue. Community involvement will hopefully steer some people back your way that have defected to ""those other"" facebook pages where commercial interest takes precedent over public safety. You need to get more accuracy in the 7 day forecast ""images"" Suggesting there will be a thunderstorm via an image on a given day when the written forecast says otherwise is aiding ""those other"" facebook sites in trashing your department. 

  Finally I live in Cairns and would love to see an AWS over on the hills behind Yarrabah again with historic data sets. This would rival Babinda for rainfall totals. Keep up the great work.",7,-8.090744,30.523567

* The dual tone weather icons (illustrating ""a few showers"", ""rain at times"", etc) would be far easier to interpret with more colours (e.g. a yellow sun, grey clouds for ""rain at times"", etc).

* On the ""Next 24 hours"" page. Have an option for wind speeds to be displayed as knots rather than Km/h.

1384,The mobile site weather is great. I've only just found it. Bit confused by a few things though. The forecast for today says rain 95% on willy weather and weatherzone with thunderstorms developing but on this site only 40% chance of rain.  Yet this site also says rain developing. Also the radar doesn't show whyalla or eastern eyre peninsula. How do I see the rain on radar for my area. I think this site would be wonderful if I could access the radar. I have a keen interest in watching the weather patterns develop. The BOM site is teaching me heaps. So Thankyou. Marilyn Sterrett.,11,2.6158650000000003,43.755542999999996

I'm using an Apple iPhone if that helps you in any way. The only other suggestion I'd make is an ""almanac"" function (high/low temps over previous 24hrs/month/year, same for rainfall totals). Apart from that, I think it looks great - very clear and easy to read.",6,-21.898129,17.617476999999997

1. Too much wasted space on front page. I would like a quick snapshot of temperature and probability of rain. Text font too big. Should be able to resize whole screen
2. Rain prediction layout is not intuitive
3. Not enough use of contrasting colours. All blue anx grey. Needs some green and red
4. I have always wanted a rain radar forecast. All the displays i have seen are all historical. I am sure the BOM has the predictions/analytics - i am just asking u make this available to the public

What I would like to see is an automated location on opening the app not the ""use current location?""  with a button choose location to allow checking other areas of interest. It is a Turn off to have to select where you are every time particularly when you arecincthecsame area day after day, or when you travel.

Allow 15 day in advance predictions and in the day eg next Thursday allow  hourly predictions of rain in all forward days. .  This is a very important feature for anyone planning any event and the feature is widely available in other weather apps. Eg accu weather, or weather zone.  I understand there may be reservations but these are easily negatised by disclaimers etc

The radar should have a drop down that let's you set the exact radar coverage (64km, 128km etc). Also adding the feature selections as per the full web radar would be cool (catchments, etc)
Comparing to Weather Zone app that I currently use, I think some of those features make the user experience much nicer: forecast graph of rainfall and temperature by hour of day, back ground graphics with the weather type, weather observations for the selected station and national forecast maps.

In the past 24 hrs view, the plot of rain looks strange. For example, Swanbourne had 0.2mm to 9am 16th May, and this was shown as a solid bar. I suggest a bar plot for each rain event (using time base of the table), maybe with a line plot for cumulative rain. Also, the rain scale needs units.

If there is space, a summary of daily climate (eg max/min T and total rain to 9 am) for the past week would help users to get information on recent weather. This could be extended to monthly and annual summaries.

Another nice feature could be derived values such as deltaT in the current weather view.
