To be frank and honest, I would use BOM over Weatherzone but you have one very, very annoying point. The Radar. When I want to see the Radar for Armidale, your system seems to think we are close to Newcastle.
It is so very annoying that it will not revert to the nearest Radar which is Namoi NOT NEWCASTLE......
Can somebody please explain to me why this is not happening or is it a case nobody has ever pointed this out to you.
I would like to use BOM but unless this issue can be resolved I just will not use it in future.
You can not even ask the app or the mobile website to pick another Radar location........
