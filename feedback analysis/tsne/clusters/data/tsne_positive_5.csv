I will also sent this feedback regarding your BOM app.  The BOM weather app is not as good as one called ""Weather Australia"" which has just stopped being supplied by www.funtopia.tv.  You have the best weather site on line (we are farmers and look a few times each day) but your app is not as usable as Weather Australia.  The main differences are - No cover page/ cloud scene when we turn it on.  Bom would be better to go straight to the page as you waste our time when we just want to check wind or rain etc before lighting a stubble or spraying a crop.  Weather Australia had four options up the top of the page, but also immediately opened into the first option page - OVERVIEW - actual data on wind temp rain etc for that day and a sentence and a scroll down to the following day below set up the same way.  Up the top of the page were the four option symbols, including three  further options: FORECAST - a one page forecast of the week  in picture/symbol and one sentence per day.

I an Android userand I think your app is awesome.

 When you click on the radar  your site uses the Sydney radar site and not Newcastle.   You should be able to select the radar you wish to use for the rain and the distance you prefer. In other applications you can do this. 

 I do you like the other features regarding whether information like temperature and likelihood of rain the other thing that would be good is the wind information for example when you're on the full site you can look at the wind direction to and from your local radar I believe this is handy for storm information.

582,"Hi,
The mobile site is great, though a couple of points.
1) If only it would give me weather for my town! 
I entered my location as postcode 4355 and chose Crows Nest Qld.
I gather we don't have a monitoring station here in Crows Nest as the mobile site tells me it is supplying data from the Oakey Qld weather station. I'm afraid Crows Nest's escarpment weather and topology is nothing like the plains of Oakey so the data is useless.
Toowoomba Qld weather would be more appropriate, though still different, as our weather tends to be more like Kingaroy for temps.

2) Pity the radar map wasn't bigger to start with - more like the Rain? App.
Hope you consider some changes - but still love your mobile site.

The mobile weather site is excellent! Just a couple of points:
* the percentage chance of rain is a little too large and should be reduced in font size a little. It is the same size as the forecast temperature.
* There should be a quick reference section showing the previous day's max and min temp, and rainfall where recorded, and a brief summary of the month to date so far.

Allow 15 day in advance predictions and in the day eg next Thursday allow  hourly predictions of rain in all forward days. .  This is a very important feature for anyone planning any event and the feature is widely available in other weather apps. Eg accu weather, or weather zone.  I understand there may be reservations but these are easily negatised by disclaimers etc

If there is space, a summary of daily climate (eg max/min T and total rain to 9 am) for the past week would help users to get information on recent weather. This could be extended to monthly and annual summaries.

Another nice feature could be derived values such as deltaT in the current weather view.
