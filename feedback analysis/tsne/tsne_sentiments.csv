"I have been looking at your site (and the others in the same industry) as part of research into whether websites like yours are actively looking at their Google rankings. I'm sure you are as it's what brings in traffic to your site.

If you're not, then there is a tool called https://www.track-r.net that lets you check your Google rankings for 7 days for free. Once you can read the data you can see if you're ahead of your competitors or not. And they give you advice on how to increase your rank, so you gain more customers. It's pretty cool.

Anyway, I'd love to get some feedback on how you are building your website's traffic so I can compile my research. It would be completely annoymous data, that would be used to see who uses PPC like Adwords or organic marketing or paid banners, for example.",positive,-0.24231833,-20.78161

"Thank you for taking my call, Thea. I will also sent this feedback regarding your BOM app.  The BOM weather app is not as good as one called ""Weather Australia"" which has just stopped being supplied by www.funtopia.tv.  You have the best weather site on line (we are farmers and look a few times each day) but your app is not as usable as Weather Australia.  The main differences are - No cover page/ cloud scene when we turn it on.  Bom would be better to go straight to the page as you waste our time when we just want to check wind or rain etc before lighting a stubble or spraying a crop.  Weather Australia had four options up the top of the page, but also immediately opened into the first option page - OVERVIEW - actual data on wind temp rain etc for that day and a sentence and a scroll down to the following day below set up the same way.  Up the top of the page were the four option symbols, including three  further options: FORECAST - a one page forecast of the week  in picture/symbol and one sentence per day. CURRENT - a page that gave specific info on dewpoint, gust, pressure temp etc for the location - great for spraying chemicals info. and RADAR - an immediate rain radar picture of Mt Gambier out about 500km suitable for Westmere so one could see rain coming for when we needed to shed sheep for shearing or check rainfast periods for spraying.

 When you click on the radar  your site uses the Sydney radar site and not Newcastle.   You should be able to select the radar you wish to use for the rain and the distance you prefer. In other applications you can do this. 

 I do you like the other features regarding whether information like temperature and likelihood of rain the other thing that would be good is the wind information for example when you're on the full site you can look at the wind direction to and from your local radar I believe this is handy for storm information.

"Hi,
The mobile site is great, though a couple of points.
1) If only it would give me weather for my town! 
I entered my location as postcode 4355 and chose Crows Nest Qld.
I gather we don't have a monitoring station here in Crows Nest as the mobile site tells me it is supplying data from the Oakey Qld weather station. I'm afraid Crows Nest's escarpment weather and topology is nothing like the plains of Oakey so the data is useless.
Toowoomba Qld weather would be more appropriate, though still different, as our weather tends to be more like Kingaroy for temps.

2) Pity the radar map wasn't bigger to start with - more like the Rain? App.
Hope you consider some changes - but still love your mobile site.

Congratulations on the new mobile site.

(It is already there for the days ahead). This would be enormously welcome and save having to repeatedly click on Launch Full Site to see this information (which somewhat reduces the value of the mobile site as a one stop shop). A day with a 60% chance of any rain and a range of 0.2-0.6mm would not encourage me to take an umbrella. A day with only a 20% chance of any rain but a range of 1-3mm would. It is the combination of both values which ultimately determines the usefulness of the app as a guide to preparing for the day ahead. Thank you. Karl Chapman,positive,42.44287,17.492828

Not just the past ""3 days"" as it does now. Sorry if this is off topic but I suspect the same people are responsible for both data sets. Can this be rectified? I love the ""WOW"" page and it is long overdue. Community involvement will hopefully steer some people back your way that have defected to ""those other"" facebook pages where commercial interest takes precedent over public safety. You need to get more accuracy in the 7 day forecast ""images"" Suggesting there will be a thunderstorm via an image on a given day when the written forecast says otherwise is aiding ""those other"" facebook sites in trashing your department.

The forecast for today says rain 95% on willy weather and weatherzone with thunderstorms developing but on this site only 40% chance of rain.  Yet this site also says rain developing. Also the radar doesn't show whyalla or eastern eyre peninsula. How do I see the rain on radar for my area. I think this site would be wonderful if I could access the radar.

The mobile weather site is excellent! Just a couple of points:
* the percentage chance of rain is a little too large and should be reduced in font size a little. It is the same size as the forecast temperature.
* There should be a quick reference section showing the previous day's max and min temp, and rainfall where recorded, and a brief summary of the month to date so far.

What I would like to see is an automated location on opening the app not the ""use current location?""  with a button choose location to allow checking other areas of interest. It is a Turn off to have to select where you are every time particularly when you arecincthecsame area day after day, or when you travel.

Allow 15 day in advance predictions and in the day eg next Thursday allow  hourly predictions of rain in all forward days. .  This is a very important feature for anyone planning any event and the feature is widely available in other weather apps. Eg accu weather, or weather zone.  I understand there may be reservations but these are easily negatised by disclaimers etc

There appears to be a small with the location search box.  It appears fine until you tap it to insert text, then it moves to another location that isn't too good.

Also, the side menu is nice, though I think it would be a nice addition if you allowed sliding the menu button as a way to open it.  Then, sliding the menu to the left should close the open menu.

Also, please please disable zoom capabilities (in HTML tags).  This will make the website much more responsive (300ms faster actually).  Currently, after a tap the browser waits for 300ms on case it's the first of a double tap, but as it's a mobile friendly site, double-tap is unnecessary.

"Looks ok and I presume I will be able to save a few places/towns as favourites.
I currently use Weatherzone+ and they use information from BOM. I like the look of their app as they have background photos that go with the weather on the day. They also show wind gusts, dew point and humidity. Their app also includes all your storm warnings.
It would be good if your app enabled us to select areas to BOM website eg rain history, education etc. I think that would allow it to be a cut above other weather apps.

"Hi
The new mobile site is good. It condenses observations, forecast, MetEye information and radar into one simple site. I would like to see the detailed information further forward than just 24 hours; maybe by clicking on the day.

I understand that dedicated mobile apps are being developed; but not initially for Android phones/tablet.s Android has the biggest market share in Australia at 57% while Windows mobile is less than 7%. http://techivian.com/kantar-windows-phone-slowing-due-aggressive-pricing-android-manufacturers/.

-need more customisation on the radar ie set kms (rain radar app provides this). Should also be able to move to an alternative radar. Great that it defaults to appropriate location though.

The radar should have a drop down that let's you set the exact radar coverage (64km, 128km etc). Also adding the feature selections as per the full web radar would be cool (catchments, etc)
Comparing to Weather Zone app that I currently use, I think some of those features make the user experience much nicer: forecast graph of rainfall and temperature by hour of day, back ground graphics with the weather type, weather observations for the selected station and national forecast maps.

If there is space, a summary of daily climate (eg max/min T and total rain to 9 am) for the past week would help users to get information on recent weather. This could be extended to monthly and annual summaries.

Another nice feature could be derived values such as deltaT in the current weather view.

General text and views are clear, though perhaps a bit of graduated colour might relieve the slightly dull impression of large regions of flat colour.
