If you're not, then there is a tool called https://www.track-r.net that lets you check your Google rankings for 7 days for free. Once you can read the data you can see if you're ahead of your competitors or not. And they give you advice on how to increase your rank, so you gain more customers. It's pretty cool.

"Thank you for taking my call, Thea. I will also sent this feedback regarding your BOM app.  The BOM weather app is not as good as one called ""Weather Australia"" which has just stopped being supplied by www.funtopia.tv.  You have the best weather site on line (we are farmers and look a few times each day) but your app is not as usable as Weather Australia.  The main differences are - No cover page/ cloud scene when we turn it on.  Bom would be better to go straight to the page as you waste our time when we just want to check wind or rain etc before lighting a stubble or spraying a crop.  Weather Australia had four options up the top of the page, but also immediately opened into the first option page - OVERVIEW - actual data on wind temp rain etc for that day and a sentence and a scroll down to the following day below set up the same way.  Up the top of the page were the four option symbols, including three  further options: FORECAST - a one page forecast of the week  in picture/symbol and one sentence per day. CURRENT - a page that gave specific info on dewpoint, gust, pressure temp etc for the location - great for spraying chemicals info. and RADAR - an immediate rain radar picture of Mt Gambier out about 500km suitable for Westmere so one could see rain coming for when we needed to shed sheep for shearing or check rainfast periods for spraying.
We programed in the location Westmere and could also change it to Mortlake or any other or ""my current location"" for if we were travelling interstate.  I hope you find this useful.",positive,0.6458225216831122,0.03869958501224435

The only thing I find a bit strange is that for the current day, the actual rain figure is reported, and the chance of rain at various times is reported, but the rain forecast (amount) for the day has disappeared! So you kind of lose the 'how much are we thinking we'll get today' bit. Maybe above the 'Rain since yesterday' you could keep the Possible rainfall.

"Dear BOM,

Thanks for providing this fantastic, localised, web-based weather information service!

Please know however that the localised live weather information for Berwick  http://m.bom.gov.au/vic/berwick/ extrapolated from Ferny Creek 19.6kms away  is significantly off, both when compared to the amateur weather station at http://www.berwickweather.info/index.php backed by subjective observation.

I strongly recommend tweaking it to make it more useful to us who live locally, and would love to take advantage of this superior, localised, mobile web-responsive (but currently inaccurate) BOM service.

Thank you.

 When you click on the radar  your site uses the Sydney radar site and not Newcastle.   You should be able to select the radar you wish to use for the rain and the distance you prefer. In other applications you can do this. 

 I do you like the other features regarding whether information like temperature and likelihood of rain the other thing that would be good is the wind information for example when you're on the full site you can look at the wind direction to and from your local radar I believe this is handy for storm information.

On opening I press ""use current location"" and always get the prompt to allow use of location w- which is annoying.as I have looked in privacy and allowed location services generally. There is no icon for this BOM app specifically. However when it does load my location I press the favourite star and it changes to full rather than outline. Back at home page it appears as a favourite, but on closing the app it does not remember the favourite setting and again asks me to allow use of location i get it to use current location.

"Hi,
The mobile site is great, though a couple of points.
1) If only it would give me weather for my town! 
I entered my location as postcode 4355 and chose Crows Nest Qld.
I gather we don't have a monitoring station here in Crows Nest as the mobile site tells me it is supplying data from the Oakey Qld weather station. I'm afraid Crows Nest's escarpment weather and topology is nothing like the plains of Oakey so the data is useless.
Toowoomba Qld weather would be more appropriate, though still different, as our weather tends to be more like Kingaroy for temps.

2) Pity the radar map wasn't bigger to start with - more like the Rain? App.
Hope you consider some changes - but still love your mobile site.

Often the temp in Stirling in the early morning is from 3 to 5 degrees colder than Mt Lofty but this site calls irself. Better to be honest and call it for what it is, namely Mt Lofty until BoM re-establishes a site for Stirling which would be more representative of this area and where people actually live.

"Congratulations on an excellent first release. I'm going to criticise your efforts not because I have a low opinion but because I like what I see so far and I want to help. You've knocked off the metro style and it works well. Use of location services is excellent. The chance of rain panel has an absurdly low information density, nobody needs ""80%"" presented graphically, use a table and show three days. The first page uses the entire screen, which is good, but there is no indication that swiping vertically will show more info.

Congratulations on the new mobile site. I have only one item of feedback/request: would you please consider adding the possible rainfall range alongside the chance of any rain for the current day view? (It is already there for the days ahead). This would be enormously welcome and save having to repeatedly click on Launch Full Site to see this information (which somewhat reduces the value of the mobile site as a one stop shop). A day with a 60% chance of any rain and a range of 0.2-0.6mm would not encourage me to take an umbrella. A day with only a 20% chance of any rain but a range of 1-3mm would. It is the combination of both values which ultimately determines the usefulness of the app as a guide to preparing for the day ahead. Thank you.

The site certainly simplifies access to local weather and rain radar functions. This is welcome; I recently noted that many steps were needed to view the rain radar, so I applaud this simpler model. 
It is highly likely that users will seek mobile access to more specialised functions on the BOM site as time goes on. This is to be expected; it indicates that users in marine or agricultural industries have the same need for simplified access to this data.

"On the app the wind speeds need to be both in k's and knots. Older people will use this app too. Particularly fishermen.  Also I emailed a request some time ago for the BoM to build an historic data base at Cairns Racecourse like they do at the Airport site (monthly , yearly temp/rain etc). Not just the past ""3 days"" as it does now. Sorry if this is off topic but I suspect the same people are responsible for both data sets. Can this be rectified? I love the ""WOW"" page and it is long overdue. Community involvement will hopefully steer some people back your way that have defected to ""those other"" facebook pages where commercial interest takes precedent over public safety. You need to get more accuracy in the 7 day forecast ""images"" Suggesting there will be a thunderstorm via an image on a given day when the written forecast says otherwise is aiding ""those other"" facebook sites in trashing your department.

The mobile site weather is great. I've only just found it. Bit confused by a few things though. The forecast for today says rain 95% on willy weather and weatherzone with thunderstorms developing but on this site only 40% chance of rain.  Yet this site also says rain developing. Also the radar doesn't show whyalla or eastern eyre peninsula. How do I see the rain on radar for my area. I think this site would be wonderful if I could access the radar.

The mobile weather site is excellent! Just a couple of points:
* the percentage chance of rain is a little too large and should be reduced in font size a little. It is the same size as the forecast temperature.

Accuracy of information is the most important thing, so looking forward to having a bom.gov.au app. I love the idea of checking previous weather reports - I haven't seen that on an app before.

What I would like to see is an automated location on opening the app not the ""use current location?""  with a button choose location to allow checking other areas of interest. It is a Turn off to have to select where you are every time particularly when you arecincthecsame area day after day, or when you travel.

Allow 15 day in advance predictions and in the day eg next Thursday allow  hourly predictions of rain in all forward days. .  This is a very important feature for anyone planning any event and the feature is widely available in other weather apps. Eg accu weather, or weather zone.  I understand there may be reservations but these are easily negatised by disclaimers etc

There appears to be a small with the location search box.  It appears fine until you tap it to insert text, then it moves to another location that isn't too good.

Also, the side menu is nice, though I think it would be a nice addition if you allowed sliding the menu button as a way to open it.  Then, sliding the menu to the left should close the open menu.

Also, please please disable zoom capabilities (in HTML tags).  This will make the website much more responsive (300ms faster actually).  Currently, after a tap the browser waits for 300ms on case it's the first of a double tap, but as it's a mobile friendly site, double-tap is unnecessary.

"Looks ok and I presume I will be able to save a few places/towns as favourites.
I currently use Weatherzone+ and they use information from BOM. I like the look of their app as they have background photos that go with the weather on the day. They also show wind gusts, dew point and humidity. Their app also includes all your storm warnings.
It would be good if your app enabled us to select areas to BOM website eg rain history, education etc. I think that would allow it to be a cut above other weather apps.

"Hi
The new mobile site is good. It condenses observations, forecast, MetEye information and radar into one simple site. I would like to see the detailed information further forward than just 24 hours; maybe by clicking on the day.

I understand that dedicated mobile apps are being developed; but not initially for Android phones/tablet.s Android has the biggest market share in Australia at 57% while Windows mobile is less than 7%. http://techivian.com/kantar-windows-phone-slowing-due-aggressive-pricing-android-manufacturers/.

-need more customisation on the radar ie set kms (rain radar app provides this). Should also be able to move to an alternative radar. Great that it defaults to appropriate location though.

- favourite icon should be more obvious - perhaps a prompt on searching for a new location I.e- would you like to save to your favourites?

- home icon needed as you can get to the warnings page detail and have to go back. Home icon should always be available

"So far the basic info looks good!
The radar should have a drop down that let's you set the exact radar coverage (64km, 128km etc). Also adding the feature selections as per the full web radar would be cool (catchments, etc)
Comparing to Weather Zone app that I currently use, I think some of those features make the user experience much nicer: forecast graph of rainfall and temperature by hour of day, back ground graphics with the weather type, weather observations for the selected station and national forecast maps.

In the past 24 hrs view, the plot of rain looks strange. For example, Swanbourne had 0.2mm to 9am 16th May, and this was shown as a solid bar. I suggest a bar plot for each rain event (using time base of the table), maybe with a line plot for cumulative rain. Also, the rain scale needs units.

If there is space, a summary of daily climate (eg max/min T and total rain to 9 am) for the past week would help users to get information on recent weather. This could be extended to monthly and annual summaries.

Another nice feature could be derived values such as deltaT in the current weather view.
