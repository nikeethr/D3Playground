If you're not, then there is a tool called https://www.track-r.net that lets you check your Google rankings for 7 days for free.

To be frank and honest, I would use BOM over Weatherzone but you have one very, very annoying point. The Radar. When I want to see the Radar for Armidale, your system seems to think we are close to Newcastle.
It is so very annoying that it will not revert to the nearest Radar which is Namoi NOT NEWCASTLE......
Can somebody please explain to me why this is not happening or is it a case nobody has ever pointed this out to you.
I would like to use BOM but unless this issue can be resolved I just will not use it in future.
You can not even ask the app or the mobile website to pick another Radar location........
Regards,

On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY, just watch this 4minute video for more information at. a href=""http://www.ABCGURU.XYZ""Seo Plugin/a

I will also sent this feedback regarding your BOM app.  The BOM weather app is not as good as one called ""Weather Australia"" which has just stopped being supplied by www.funtopia.tv.  You have the best weather site on line (we are farmers and look a few times each day) but your app is not as usable as Weather Australia.  The main differences are - No cover page/ cloud scene when we turn it on.  Bom would be better to go straight to the page as you waste our time when we just want to check wind or rain etc before lighting a stubble or spraying a crop.  Weather Australia had four options up the top of the page, but also immediately opened into the first option page - OVERVIEW - actual data on wind temp rain etc for that day and a sentence and a scroll down to the following day below set up the same way.  Up the top of the page were the four option symbols, including three  further options: FORECAST - a one page forecast of the week  in picture/symbol and one sentence per day. CURRENT - a page that gave specific info on dewpoint, gust, pressure temp etc for the location - great for spraying chemicals info. and RADAR - an immediate rain radar picture of Mt Gambier out about 500km suitable for Westmere so one could see rain coming for when we needed to shed sheep for shearing or check rainfast periods for spraying.
We programed in the location Westmere and could also change it to Mortlake or any other or ""my current location"" for if we were travelling interstate.

I an Android userand I think your app is awesome. For the last couple of years I've been hoping that you would include an 'expected rainfall' figure after the 'rain since' figure on the 'next 24 hours' page. Unless you look at the weather the day before you have no clue as to the expected rainfall when it's actually raining! Not a criticism, just a thought. Great app.

Instead of temp   wave height on the ""next 24hrs"" graph, it may be more relevant (as a weather-focussed page) to graph temp   chance of rain and leave the wave height with wind speed as a point-selection item. 
Love the mobile pages. All relevant info is really easy to see. Great job and a great service. 
Cheers,

We live in BEERWAH 4519.  
As the two nearest weather stations are Nambour to the north and Beerburrum to the south we never seem to get the weather that you predict.  Is it possible to have a weather station nearer and more realistic please.  We are in the shelter of Mt. Mellum and I know there is a weather station there which other weather sites use. Well that's what they say.

The only thing I find a bit strange is that for the current day, the actual rain figure is reported, and the chance of rain at various times is reported, but the rain forecast (amount) for the day has disappeared! So you kind of lose the 'how much are we thinking we'll get today' bit. Maybe above the 'Rain since yesterday' you could keep the Possible rainfall.

I like your mobile weather website. I have it saved as a shortcut on my phones homescreen so there's no need to download another app or anything.

I like the layout the font size is very good and different features it shows keep them. I wondering if say in the bottom right corner there's a bit of room perhaps add say sunrise sunset and high tide low tide and maybe next to % for chance of rain predicted barometric pressure an arrow next to it indicating if going up or down or if not possible next to current % on the same line. 

Maybe even uv index on the page with graph but not on main page might be to much bad news to look at everyday. High abd kow tides could be on the graph assuming it has a time frame havent looked at it properly. This is my feedback whatever u do don't made things tiny keep what u have now and fill the gaps perhaps.

I just left feedback in regards to your radar image and Cessnock. I performed a couple of tests and if I use the code 2325 and pick the closest suburb to me It then uses the Newcastle radar. 

 If I use the options using my location  or search for Cessnock it takes me to the Sydney radar. 

if I use the 2320 postcode and select another area it takes me to the Newcastle radar.

This should be addressed so that residents  in the Cessnock area can get the correct Radar information when using your app.

When I used the postcode of 2325...... Cessnock was not displayed......when I  searched Cessnock the postcode was displayed as 2320 which is incorrect. The postcode for Cessnock is 2325.

 When you click on the radar  your site uses the Sydney radar site and not Newcastle.   You should be able to select the radar you wish to use for the rain and the distance you prefer. In other applications you can do this. 

 I do you like the other features regarding whether information like temperature and likelihood of rain the other thing that would be good is the wind information for example when you're on the full site you can look at the wind direction to and from your local radar I believe this is handy for storm information. 

Otherwise you have a good app nice clear information and no weapon otherwise you have a good app nice clear information and no ads.

Come the wet season,we use the radar and reports on a daily basis to help make logistical decisions for our bus routes and the potential for flooded roadways, etc. Is there any chance that the mobile site would or could have the same display options as the full site,in terms of roads,rivers and catchment areas?

The interface design is great and it's easy to navigate. I particularly like the 'Forecast for the next 24 hours' tab and the 3-hourly predictions. One thing I'd like to be added is the UV Index for each day.

The mobile site is great, though a couple of points.
1) If only it would give me weather for my town! 
I entered my location as postcode 4355 and chose Crows Nest Qld.
I gather we don't have a monitoring station here in Crows Nest as the mobile site tells me it is supplying data from the Oakey Qld weather station. I'm afraid Crows Nest's escarpment weather and topology is nothing like the plains of Oakey so the data is useless.
Toowoomba Qld weather would be more appropriate, though still different, as our weather tends to be more like Kingaroy for temps.

2) Pity the radar map wasn't bigger to start with - more like the Rain? App.
Hope you consider some changes - but still love your mobile site.

But, for Launceston radar, PLEASE PLEASE link to the north west Tasmania radar or better still, a composite of the NW TAs radar   Hobart radar. The map view also needs to centre on the town requested as per MetEye, because for instance in our case Launceston is off the edge. On its own, the Hobart radar is not much use to Launceston because the weather almost never comes from the south east. It is nearly always from the westerly points.

I check BOM most mornings to get an idea about today's weather and I also access the radar site at times.  An app would be much quicker to access than searching bookmarks.

Interesting idea about giving only the weather within a 7km or so radius of the location of the device - handy when I'm staying in one place, but if I'm going elsewhere, I'll need to remember to put the postcode or suburb in for that area too.    (FYI home: Sandringham, often in the city as well 20km away)  

The ""what it feels like"" (temp info) is brilliant!   Thanks.  

Two things that would be helpful for me:
1.  I'd also like to see, not just the rain predicted, but also how much cloud is likely to occur.  We live in a passive solar designed house which is brilliant when the sun is shining.  If it's going to be overcast for a long time in the winter, we'll light our wood heater, but we don't want to do that if the sun is likely to come out again.

2.  Some of the terms you use for various parts of your website have been confusing for me, so over the past couple of years or so, I've re-named them as I've bookmarked them.  Could you please think about renaming some site components - particularly with regards to whether it's a chart or a map (it could be as simple as C for Chart or M for Map).   eg.  Latest Observations is a chart re: temp wind rain & pressure,  whereas Marine wind forecast is a map with arrows and Tide predictions is a map with markers to zoom in on.   It helps me visualise what component of the site I was looking at previously in order to find the one I want again. 

Also, FYI - all of your BOM sites are slow to come up on screen today - both the mobile and original ones and it's also slow switching between tabs/components/other areas of site.   Therefore 1. I haven't had the time to look at all of your tabs and 2.  and if it continues like that, I'll probably only look at one basic site and not the other information you have available.
I don't know if the issue is on your end, with the server, or possibly a poor connection in our house, but usually I get the information much more quickly.  I hope your app will be quick.",potterae1@gmail.com,/vic/moorabbin/,0412966447,5,2015-08-06 03:31:45,1438831905,"http://oias.bom.gov.au:8700/tms/S2_RESPONSE_RP?PARAMKEY=SurveyId=MOBILE_FKB_13,RespId=1438831905",0,0.0

My problem with the Stirling SA forecast is that it is actually for Mt Lofty, some 5km, 200m higher and on top of the ridge. Observations for the 2 locations differ markedly on many occasions. Eg the forecast for this Saturday predicts 15-25mm. Well 25 was the reading for Mt Lofty this morning with 15 near Stirling. Often the temp in Stirling in the early morning is from 3 to 5 degrees colder than Mt Lofty but this site calls irself. Better to be honest and call it for what it is, namely Mt Lofty until BoM re-establishes a site for Stirling which would be more representative of this area and where people actually live.

On the forecast page you show the chance of rain for specific periods through the day, but do not show the likely amount, yet you do show it for future days. 

I find the likely amount is a better indicator of the likely effect of rain on my planned farming activities. A high likelihood of less than 1 mm hardly causes much change! But a forecast of say 10 mm with 50% probability does!

I know we do get occasional water spouts, which technically are tornadoes on water. I have seen reports of fire tornadoes.   To me Whittlesea was the perfect venue for tornadoes - hot northerly winds clashing with cold air around the mountains. The US is perfect for tornadoes, particularly with warm air from the Gulf clashing with Arctic jet streams. Thank god we rarely experience those conditions.

The online pic showed a typical super cell formation which one would expect to generate a tornado, plus the anvil shape of cloud cover. The only thing it didn't appear to have was the greenish tinge under the anvil shape. Most definitely the correct decision to broadcast a potential tornado threat. We both know a major tornado is well overdue, easily around an F4/EF3, possibly even an F5.

2) Can you please allow the user to pan the radar image when viewing on the mobile website? On the desktop site you have navigation buttons to pan the view. If I could drag the view and zoom using multitouch, it would be a killer app.

Issues I've noticed:
- looking at the past 24hrs weather the chart and tables of weather do not match for the weather observations. For 3pm it shows the temperature is 26deg when current temp is showing 22deg. 

- chance of 24hr rain doesn't match the home page predictions for the day. Number of occasions I look at the rain predictions and there might be a high chance of rain showing on the home page for the day then you look at the next 24hrs and there is very low day chance showing for the day

I'm work for Fisheries Queensland and am currently involved with the development of a recreational fishing app.  As part of this it would be great to provide a link in the app to the mobile warnings page of your app for a given state.  Currently we can only send the user directly to the main screen.

Are there any plans to enable this? eg. http://m.bom.gov.au/qld/warnings would take the user to the warning page for that state?  Currently the url requires an actually location.

Your help with this matter is greatly appreciated.

I have only one item of feedback/request: would you please consider adding the possible rainfall range alongside the chance of any rain for the current day view? (It is already there for the days ahead). This would be enormously welcome and save having to repeatedly click on Launch Full Site to see this information (which somewhat reduces the value of the mobile site as a one stop shop). A day with a 60% chance of any rain and a range of 0.2-0.6mm would not encourage me to take an umbrella. A day with only a 20% chance of any rain but a range of 1-3mm would. It is the combination of both values which ultimately determines the usefulness of the app as a guide to preparing for the day ahead. Thank you.

The site certainly simplifies access to local weather and rain radar functions. This is welcome; I recently noted that many steps were needed to view the rain radar, so I applaud this simpler model. 
It is highly likely that users will seek mobile access to more specialised functions on the BOM site as time goes on. This is to be expected; it indicates that users in marine or agricultural industries have the same need for simplified access to this data.

It's my understanding is you have gone for a clean and simple look so it can load easily on all devices and I really like this approach. The only things I can think of that would improve this experience is to make it an app, and also to add a simple tide chart with its current height plus times for high and low tide. I use both weatherzone pro and willyweather for tides but prefer willyweather for some reason and it's tide curve but on both it's mutiple presses to get from the page the app loads to where I can see the tide curve. If you can add a simple tide curve (like willyweather but not have it adjustable for simplicity and maybe only show the next hi and low) to the main screen and on the tide curve show a dot or vertical line for current height but include the times for the next high and low I would find this a great advantage and I think it could be done to look clean and simple and fit easily into the main page. But I presume the hard bit would be to integrated it in and to show different tides for different areas while those same areas show same current weather. Example: I live in sisters beach Tasmania. As there is no weather station here we get current weather from Wynyard airport, but the tide info wold have to be for sisters beach. But I'm sure you guys can handle that as in your app it shows the future days for sisters beach a different temp to Wynyard even though our current temp is the same. From using willyweather on pc for a while now to look up tides, it can have a few tide locations for the ne small town. But blah blah harda harda, make it an app and add a simple tide curve with current height marked plus showing times for high and low and this would be perfect for my use. I'll shut up now.",jadehennessy@live.com.au,/tas/sisters-beach/,0364451878,5,2014-06-09 12:10:26,1402315826,"http://oias.bom.gov.au:8700/tms/S2_RESPONSE_RP?PARAMKEY=SurveyId=MOBILE_FKB_13,RespId=1402315826",0,0.0

I like the lay out and accuracy, maybe some more info on upcoming days but to tell you the truth I don't really miss it. I use weatherzone pro and also willy weather. I have loaded this mobile website on safari and then chose the option to add it to homepage so it looks like an app. When you click on the icon it then loads in safari and can find multiple tabs open all from previous uses of the bom icon, so if this was an app it would eliminate this issue. I probably prefer the better look of weatherzone but prefer accuracy over looks and simplicity. If I rated it on looks alone it I would say 1 weatherzone 2 bom 3 willy weather. If I rated them on accuracy it would be 1 bom 2 will weather 3 weatherzone and I now finding weatherzone not updating as often. The other issue with weatherzone is for some reason it now doesn't show Burnie Tasmania current temp and uses Wynyard airport instead. Willy weather and bom find a Burnie current temp, bom says Burnie port and willy weather says Hillcrest (but neither show a feels like temp for Burnie). Overall a great mobile website and now use this over paid apps on both my iPad and iPhone even though the 2 others apps uses bom data, it's just not updated as quickly. Only real improvement that would make a difference to me would be to make it an app for both iOS and android. I tried making a homescreen shortcut on a friends android and couldn't work out how so she doesn't use it on phone as she has weatherzone, but she uses bom shortcut on iPad as she lives in Burnie and weatherzone doesn't show Burnie current temp, plus she loves the weatherzone widget hoping one day you might implement that into the android version then this app would make all other apps redundant or at least it would make the creators of the other apps that use bom data to make it more accurate. Either way it's win win..

At a glance the mobile site is quite nice and functional. I will test some more over coming weeks. 
Currently I have two mobile devices, 4"" and 7"" screens. (both Android Nexus')
On the 4"" I almost always want the mobile site but occasionally click 'request desktop site'
On the 7"" I almost always want the opposite.
Having a separate subdomain for your mobile site breaks this functionality most of the time.

I feel responsive design is the preferred industry way of getting this right and I htink Google rankings are affected by this.
It can also be done from the serverside(1) but you should make sure that you give the end user the option to switch as per my points above.

Last thing.
I am interested in why you have chosen to develop a Windows phone app before an Android app.
The market share for Android is surely quite high and would result in a high uptake of the app.

Yet this site also says rain developing. Also the radar doesn't show whyalla or eastern eyre peninsula. How do I see the rain on radar for my area.

Looked at previous/next 24 hr pages and liked the split of times/forecasts, including % chance of rain, or observations recorded. Prefer that the table or graph/chart tabs say what they are rather than use a symbol but easy to learn after one use so not a bit issue. Liked the scroll bar/line on the chart to identify observations for different times over the last 24 hrs. Colour, font, etc makes information easy to read and not too busy. A significant improvement on the current BoM website and more of a product that stacks up against some of the other weather Apps.

I'd like to see temp and wind speed overlay options for locations on the radar screens and accumulated rainfall would be exceptionally useful on advanced radars like Brisbane. Also tsunami alerts as a pop up window if the phone location was on the coast in an affected area would be awesome. I'd love to be on any beta testing list for your iOS app development.

The mobile weather site is excellent! Just a couple of points:
* the percentage chance of rain is a little too large and should be reduced in font size a little. It is the same size as the forecast temperature.
* There should be a quick reference section showing the previous day's max and min temp, and rainfall where recorded, and a brief summary of the month to date so far.

What I would like to see is an automated location on opening the app not the ""use current location?""  with a button choose location to allow checking other areas of interest. It is a Turn off to have to select where you are every time particularly when you arecincthecsame area day after day, or when you travel.

Allow 15 day in advance predictions and in the day eg next Thursday allow  hourly predictions of rain in all forward days. .  This is a very important feature for anyone planning any event and the feature is widely available in other weather apps. Eg accu weather, or weather zone.  I understand there may be reservations but these are easily negatised by disclaimers etc

There appears to be a small with the location search box.  It appears fine until you tap it to insert text, then it moves to another location that isn't too good.

Also, the side menu is nice, though I think it would be a nice addition if you allowed sliding the menu button as a way to open it.  Then, sliding the menu to the left should close the open menu.

Also, please please disable zoom capabilities (in HTML tags).  This will make the website much more responsive (300ms faster actually).  Currently, after a tap the browser waits for 300ms on case it's the first of a double tap, but as it's a mobile friendly site, double-tap is unnecessary.

I currently use Weatherzone+ and they use information from BOM. I like the look of their app as they have background photos that go with the weather on the day. They also show wind gusts, dew point and humidity. Their app also includes all your storm warnings.
It would be good if your app enabled us to select areas to BOM website eg rain history, education etc. I think that would allow it to be a cut above other weather apps.

The new mobile site is good. It condenses observations, forecast, MetEye information and radar into one simple site. I would like to see the detailed information further forward than just 24 hours; maybe by clicking on the day.

I understand that dedicated mobile apps are being developed; but not initially for Android phones/tablet.s Android has the biggest market share in Australia at 57% while Windows mobile is less than 7%. http://techivian.com/kantar-windows-phone-slowing-due-aggressive-pricing-android-manufacturers/.

-need more customisation on the radar ie set kms (rain radar app provides this). Should also be able to move to an alternative radar. Great that it defaults to appropriate location though.

- favourite icon should be more obvious - perhaps a prompt on searching for a new location I.e- would you like to save to your favourites?

- home icon needed as you can get to the warnings page detail and have to go back. Home icon should always be available

- swell/ tide info would be very useful

- the handle to control favourites is great and very user friendly

- app icon is great too

The radar should have a drop down that let's you set the exact radar coverage (64km, 128km etc). Also adding the feature selections as per the full web radar would be cool (catchments, etc)

Slow radar animation, too fast.

Show your location on radar, eg a dot.

When double tap radar it will zoom in, so you dont have to pinch to zoom. Easier for one hand operation.

On the weather page place the daily extremes, eg max min so far.

I'm looking at Forster NSW weather but my data may be coming from Taree Airport Automated Service. It would be nice to have the source location in italics or in brackets and in a smaller font near the location requested. eg FORSTER (Taree AS) or is it Williamtown Airport?

It makes a big difference if you are looking at a coastal location but the data source is 20km inland.

Is it possible to introduce a google/apple maps process of dragging the map across the screen to change from one radar site to another? e.g. If you are viewing MLB radar on 512 range, and wanted to see what is happening over the VIC/SA border, it would be great to be able to select and hold the map near the SA border and drag the map to the right. When you let go, the effect could be for the radar coverage to start displaying the map around Mt Gambier radar at 512 resolution.

In the past 24 hrs view, the plot of rain looks strange. For example, Swanbourne had 0.2mm to 9am 16th May, and this was shown as a solid bar. I suggest a bar plot for each rain event (using time base of the table), maybe with a line plot for cumulative rain. Also, the rain scale needs units.

If there is space, a summary of daily climate (eg max/min T and total rain to 9 am) for the past week would help users to get information on recent weather. This could be extended to monthly and annual summaries.

Another nice feature could be derived values such as deltaT in the current weather view.

- The zoom in and out buttons on the radar page are excellent. The page would be enhanced with the crosshairs and distance ranges, a tag to show which radar range you are looking at (eg. ""128 km"", and buttons to allow you to step forward and back through the time sequence.

In addition, I think it would be handy to hyperlink the ""tomorrow"" temperature at the top right of the page to automatically scroll down the page to the forecast details further down when touched. 

Otherwise, I think the level of information is good and there are lots of good features here (e.g., favourite places, recently viewed, etc).

* Add observed extremes including MaxT, MinT, Max Wind Gust and rainfall since 0900 for the day in conjunction with the existing current conditions.
* Add doppler RADAR and AWS observations layer to RADAR.
* Use the closest AWS to a location as opposed to the nearest SYNOP site for current conditions. For example, Corowa uses the Corowa SYNOP which is only 0900 and 1500. Instead, current conditions would be more reflective of the Rutherglen AWS and provides more information to the user.

Instead it linked to a page with more detailed information for Thursday, but it wasn't clear straight away that this was what I was looking at. A way to make it clearer could be to add a label to this more detailed page saying ""24 hours up to 7:30 am Thursday"" or similar.. or alternatively, rename the ""next 24 hours"" button to ""detailed 24 hour forecast"" or similar.
