STAGE 1

- Implement sankey diagram using D3
	- Read up on d3-sankey
	- Read up on Gauss-Seidel method
	- Create dummy dataset for event tracking
	- Create sankey diagram (static)
===

===
STAGE 2

[V1]
- Implement subchart 1: click node ||
	- If C, show A breakdown as bar chart
	- If A, show L table
	- If L, show all C-A-L pathways - this should be unique (ideally all
	  labels should be unique)
	- For all, show number of unique events and % of total unique events

- Implement subchart 2: click group (C/A/L)
	- For C/A show overall breakdown |description|nodes (e.g. no.
	  actions)|unique events|%|
	- For L table of labels |description|count (instead of nodes)|unique
	  events|%|
	- unique events can have relative bar size...
	- % can have a tiny pie chart next to the number...

- Implement subchart 3: click link
	- Show number of unique events and % of total unique events
	- Show link pair description

[V2]
===

===
STAGE 3
- Implement custom sankey diagram
	- Todo: insert various readings/algos here e.g. links, nodes text etc.

NOTES

[2018-04-05]

Need to convert data to following format:


{
	"nodes": [
		{	
			"name":"abc"
		},
		...
	],

	"links": [
		{
			"source":1,
			"target":2,
			"value":200,
		},
		...
	],
}

1) data generator [x]
2) data to graph json convertor [x]

 ----------------------------------
 stage 1 progress: [==        ] 20%
 ----------------------------------

[2018-04-09]

Play around with sankey plugin.

1) create static graph []
2) re-think what to show on "click" []
3) click for secondary graph - simplistic version for now []

d3-sankey@0.7.1 has changes to algorithm compared to @0.6. Tend to like visual
asthetics of @0.6 better... need to test out with random-gen CAL.
